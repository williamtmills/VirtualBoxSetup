## Setting up VirtualBox

This tutorial will describe how to setup a virtual computer running a Linux-based operating system on your personal computer.

### Download VirtualBox

1. Visit [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).
2. Click the blue button that says 'Download VirtualBox 6.1' (though this button may contain a different number for future versions).
3. Click the link for your current operating system (Windows, (Mac) OS X, etc.). **NOTE:** Clicking this link will begin the download automatically.

### Download Ubuntu

1. Visit [Ubuntu](ubuntu.com).
2. Click on the 'Download' tab in the top right.
3. Under 'Ubuntu Desktop', click the green button that says '20.04 LTS' (though the number may be different in the future, this green button represents the newest, most well supported version of Ubuntu). **NOTE:** Clicking this button will begin the download automatically.

### Installing VirtualBox

1. Locate the VirtualBox file downloaded above.

    - For Mac, file should appear as: `VirtualBox-6.1.32-149290-OSX.dmg`
    - For Windows, file should appear as: `VirtualBox-6.1.32-149290-Win.exe`

2. Double click the file to begin installation and follow the on-screen prompts.

**NOTE:** Security setting on your computer may prevent VirtualBox from loading. If this occurs (on Mac),

1. Go to 'System Preferences'.
2. Click 'Security & Privacy'.
3. Next to the message that reads 'System software from developer "Oracle America Inc." was blocked from loading', click 'Allow'.

### Create a virtual computer

1. Open VirtualBox application (if not open already).
2. Select 'New'.
3. Fill out the 'Name and operating system' form and click 'Continue'.

4. Fill out the 'Memory size' form and click 'Continue'. This number should be kept below half of the RAM available on your computer. For example, on a computer with 16 GB of RAM, select 8 GB (8192 MB).

5. Fill out the 'Hard disk' form and click 'Create'.

6. Fill out 'Hard disk file type' form.

VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image)

7. Fill out 'Storage on physical hard disk' form

Dynamically allocated

8. Fill out the 'File location and size' form. The amount of memory you allocate to the virtual computer should depend on the needs of your bioinformatic pipelines and the memory available on your computer. An appropriate starting place would be 20 GB. If you should run out of space in the future, this number can be increased.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/williamtmills/VirtualBoxSetup/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Test. Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/williamtmills/VirtualBoxSetup/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
